# signal in the noise

A Hugo generated static blog, hosted [here](http://Zsailer.github.io).

The blog includes useful pieces of scientific/coding information, easy-to-follow tutorials, and humorous posts for fun. 

This repo contains the files used to build the static website, and the website is kept in a separate [repo](https://github.com/Zsailer/Zsailer.github.io).
